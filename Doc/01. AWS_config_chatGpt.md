The `aws configure` command in the AWS CLI sets up the configuration for your AWS credentials and region settings. When you run `aws configure`, it stores the configuration details in two files located in your home directory. These files are:

1. **Credentials File**: `~/.aws/credentials`
2. **Config File**: `~/.aws/config`

### Finding the Location of the AWS Configuration Files

1. **Default Location**:
   - **Credentials File**: `/root/.aws/credentials`
   - **Config File**: `/root/.aws/config`

2. **Using the `aws` CLI Command**:
   You can use the `aws` CLI to display the location of the configuration files.

   ```sh
   aws configure list
   ```

   This command will show you where the AWS CLI is reading its configuration and credentials from.

### Example: Running `aws configure` in a Docker Container

When running in a Docker container, the configuration files are typically located in the home directory of the user running the command. If you are running commands as `root`, the files will be located in `/root/.aws/`.

1. **Open a Shell in Your Docker Container**:
   ```sh
   docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Run `aws configure`**:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

3. **Verify the Files**:
   After running `aws configure`, you can check the files:

   ```sh
   cat /root/.aws/credentials
   cat /root/.aws/config
   ```

### Using a Non-Root User

If you are running `aws configure` as a non-root user (e.g., `airflow`), the files will be located in the home directory of that user, such as `/home/airflow/.aws/`.

1. **Switch to the Airflow User**:
   ```sh
   su - airflow
   ```

2. **Run `aws configure` as the Airflow User**:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Verify the Files**:
   Check the AWS configuration files for the `airflow` user:

   ```sh
   cat /home/airflow/.aws/credentials
   cat /home/airflow/.aws/config
   ```

### Summary

The `aws configure` command stores your AWS configuration in the `~/.aws/` directory of the user running the command. This is typically `/root/.aws/` for the root user or `/home/username/.aws/` for any other user. You can verify the contents of these files to ensure your AWS CLI is configured correctly.
