The output of `aws configure list` indicates that the AWS CLI is using a shared credentials file, but it appears that the `credentials` file is not in the `/home/airflow/.aws/` directory. This might be because the AWS CLI configuration was set up for a different user, such as `root`.

To locate and verify the AWS CLI configuration, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Check the Root User's AWS Directory**:
   Since you are currently logged in as `root`, check if the credentials file is in the root user's AWS configuration directory.

   ```sh
   cat /root/.aws/credentials
   ```

   Similarly, check the config file:

   ```sh
   cat /root/.aws/config
   ```

2. **Ensure the Airflow User Has a Configuration Directory**:
   If the credentials are set for `root`, but you need them to be available for the `airflow` user, copy the configuration files to the `airflow` user's home directory.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p /home/airflow/.aws
   cp /root/.aws/credentials /home/airflow/.aws/credentials
   cp /root/.aws/config /home/airflow/.aws/config
   chown -R airflow:airflow /home/airflow/.aws
   ```

3. **Verify the Files for the Airflow User**:
   Switch to the `airflow` user and verify the AWS configuration files.

   ```sh
   su - airflow
   cat ~/.aws/credentials
   cat ~/.aws/config
   ```

### Summary

The AWS CLI configuration files are likely set up for the `root` user in `/root/.aws/`. If the configuration should be used by the `airflow` user, you need to copy the credentials and config files to the `airflow` user's home directory and ensure proper permissions. This way, the `airflow` user will have the necessary AWS credentials and configuration.
